## Hey! ##

So I've had the wireframe for this particular portfolio design but with all work stuff, I wasn't able to draft this. I took the time-off before going back to school, and finished this in a month. It's not close to being perfect, some responsive elements are stuck. But, it's ready. Hope you dig it :)
